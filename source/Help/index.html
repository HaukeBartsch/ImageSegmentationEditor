<H1>Image Segmentation Editor</H1>

<p>The Image Segmentation Editor allows you to draw on volumetric images loaded as either mgz or DICOM. Be aware that it is a very
crude tool. Development was stopped after it became tolerably bad judged by people with a high pain threshold. It is modeled after
the Amira Segmentation Editor (best segmentation tool ever) and can do one thing more (manually segment color images) and everything
else less. Each region outlined by the user can be assigned a label name and a color. A list of these labels is stored in a label
file (mgh format with a secondary json file) and can be loaded at a later time.</p>

<p>Each volume element (voxel) in the label file can have a single label assigned to it. If you need overlapping
label more than one label file is required.</p>

<H2>Workflow</H2>

<p>Start by loading image data into the Image Segmentation Editor. The editor can read volumes in mgh format and
volumes that are stored as DICOM (*.dcm). Each loaded volume is represented by an icon on the top of the display.
Selecting a different icon will switch to the new volume. As a short-cut press the number keys to switch from
one loaded volume to the next.</p>

<p>Next create a label file (or load one). The label file needs to be stored on your harddrive. Once a label file
is exists the label list on the left of the interface becomes active. By default each voxel belongs to the material
"Exterior" which corresponds to the number '0'. Numbers are used to encode the label type in the label file that
is stored on disk. In order to store the name of a label and its color a second .json file is stored next to the
.mgh file representing the label.</p>

<p>Segmentation is the process of highlighting voxel and assigning these voxels to labels from the label list. Create the
required list of labels for your work. For example add a new label "lesion" if you want to assign the voxel of a lesion.
Use the Brush tool to draw on one of the three images. Use the mouse wheel to switch to neighboring slices. Every voxel you
paint will turn red and is stored temporarily as a highlight. Now assign
these highlighted voxel to your lesion label by selecting the row marked "lesion" and by pressing the "Add" button.
This will permanently assign the lesion label to the voxel in your highlight. As a result your highlight (red) is
removed and replaced with voxel that have the color of your label. In the same manner voxel can be removed from
existing label ("Remove" button).
</p>

<p>A small list of tools is provided to paint your regions. The Brush tool allows you to draw in a 1-4 radius 2D region. The
magic wand tool is specific to the location the mouse selects and uses region growing in 2D to select similar voxel close by.</p>

<p>Remember to save your label file before you quit the program.</p>
